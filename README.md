# Pareto2d

The data file contains Instances of Pareto Fronts in dimension 2 (2D PF).

These instances are used in the paper 

"J. Huang,  Z. Chen, N. Dupin,  Comparing local search initialization for k-means and k-medoids clustering in a planar Pareto Front, a computational study, 2021, Springer."
presented in the conference OLA 2021:

The generation algorithm of instancs is presented in the paper.

The results instance by instance are available in the "results" file, distinguished for k-means and k-medoids
